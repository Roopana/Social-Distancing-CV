## Dataset we used for ground plane detection:

Existing datasets to generate a birds eye view image either make use of horizon lines, vanishing points or intrinsic parameters of camera or single image captured from multiple cameras at mutiple distances. 
However, our objective is to identify the groud plane in an image and transform to the bird's eye view. To achieve this we put together our dataset with 580 images by web scraping and annotating the ground plane in matlab. 
This is used to train our CNN model to identify homography matrix to convert a given image to bird's eye view.
