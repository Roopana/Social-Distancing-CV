## YOLOv3 for object detection

This module consists of the YOLOv3 code borrowed from darknet and pyimagesearch and modified to get co-ordinates of the bounding boxes of detected objects. 

We could not upload the actual model and weights we used in our project, due to the file size limit. They can be downloaded from the original source URLs:

* YOLOV3 pretrained model weights: wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
* YOLOV3 pretrained Model: git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
