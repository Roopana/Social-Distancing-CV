# Social-Distancing-CV

Link to our dataset: In form of [individual images](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XLzIjKbUafkdz5T_jM_RwI44TkizzaaG/view?usp=sharing) and [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XYTxtSbneh4NQOrSUtVovzC1_HzcdvM0/view?usp=sharing) (to run with Faster R-CNN)

To run the people counting with Faster R-CNN, open the Google Colab Notebook [baseline.ipynb](https://github.com/nguy4130/Social-Distancing-CV/blob/main/baseline.ipynb)

We used Yang and Yurtsever's paper and code [here](https://github.com/dongfang-steven-yang/social-distancing-monitoring) for the people counting baseline. Please give them a reference if you used their work.
